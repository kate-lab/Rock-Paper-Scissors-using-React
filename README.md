# React Rock Paper Scissors

Built in 3 hours, this is a simple Rock Paper Scissors Game, using React.js, with some Bootstrap elements for the styling. This was an opportunity for me to practice building a React app, working with components, state and hooks, and rebuilding my first ever piece of Vanilla JavaScript [Lapis, Papyrus, Scalpellus](https://codepen.io/katelab/pen/bGWrOrv) in a totally different way through React.

To run server: yarn start

## Brief

- When a user makes their choice (rock, paper or scissors), you should also
  randomly generate a computer choice
- Write some logic to determine who has won
- Display the player's choice and the computer's choice
- Display the winner on the page
- When the reset button is clicked, clear the choices and the winner from the
  screen
